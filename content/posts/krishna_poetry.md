***I bow to your Lotus Feet***

***Which is there in every town and street.*** ||

***I am incomplete without your compassion***

***You are there behind all my satisfaction.*** ||

***You always helped me there when I was in pain***

***I don't want anything where you do not remain.*** ||

***Hey Prabhu I want to be your eternal servant***

***Give me the knowledge and peace with some prevent.*** ||

***Make me a particle in air so that I can pass by your flute as atom***

***My Lord you are the one who gave me a chance to sit with Prabhupada in one Dome.*** ||

***I was abandoned with materialistic people here in Hyderabad***

***But now I am all good and got a chance to serve the Lotus Feet with your Ashirbad.*** ||

***The world is now suffering with Corona and many people need spiritual prerana***

***Hey my Lord give some Kripa-Bristhi, we all know you are the one who Lord filled with Karuna.*** ||
