      <description>I bow to your Lotus Feet
Which is there in every town and street. ||
I am incomplete without your compassion
You are there behind all my satisfaction. ||
You always helped me there when I was in pain
I don&amp;rsquo;t want anything where you do not remain. ||
Hey Prabhu I want to be your eternal servant
Give me the knowledge and peace with some prevent. ||
Make me a particle in air so that I can pass by your flute as atom</description>
