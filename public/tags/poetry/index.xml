      <description>I bow to your Lotus Feet
Which is there in every town and street.
I am incomplete without your compassion You are there behind all my satisfaction.
You always helped me there when I was in pain I don&amp;rsquo;t want anything where you do not remain.
Hey Prabhu I want to be your eternal servant Give me the knowledge and peace with some prevent.
Make me a particle in air so that I can pass by your flute as atom My Lord you are the one who gave me a chance to sit with Prabhupada in one Dome.</description>
